  An input expression consists of phonemes '|' representing or, '&' representing and, '!' representing not and '(' and ')' for grouping. For example, "p&b" searches for languages with the voiced and voiceless bilabial stops, and "ฮธ|รฐ" seraches for languages with the voiced and/or voiceless dental fricatives.
  
  Right now there is no consideration of allophony, but this may change in the future.
